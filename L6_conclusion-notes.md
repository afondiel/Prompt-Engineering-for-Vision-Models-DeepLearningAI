# Summary

- You've learned how to isolate any part of an image using SAM
- You've also prompted OWL-ViT in order to segment objects in an image using only text
- You combined object detection, image segmentation, and guided diffusion0:1Z to programmatically create entirely new images
- You also fine tune stable diffusion with the dreambooth method,0.23 so that it can generate images of a custom object
- If you have access to GPUs, such as with Google Colab, you can try  iterating on your own prompts and fine tuning the models further with GPUs
- Perhaps you can expand these inpainting pipeline methods to video editing
- Now that there are more foundational models, you'll have more apportunities to apply prompt engineering to yout combuter vision applications
- We look forward to seeing what you'll build next.
